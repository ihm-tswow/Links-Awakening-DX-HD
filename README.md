# Links Awakening DX HD

This is an **UNAFFILIATED FORK** off [Link's Awakening DX HD](https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd). Currently it's just slightly easier to build/publish than the itch.io version.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ihm-tswow/Links-Awakening-DX-HD/wiki) for a brief documentation of the in-game tools.

## Prerequisites

- (Very) Basic knowledge of C# and Visual Studio
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    - Make sure to select `.NET desktop development` components in the visual studio installer.

## Build Instructions

- Clone this repository
- Open ProjectZ.sln
- Build/run like any normal C# program

## Publishing

To publish, you can run the `publish.bat`, which will produce the folder `Publish` that you can send to your friends.
